A robotics & AI systems engineering company with over a decade of experience in semiconductor automation, now advancing into the Jetson edge AI + cloud GPU era. My work bridges biometric sensing, real-time inference, and RAG+MCP agents in smart manufacturing and healthcare.

üöÄ What I‚Äôm Building

Jetson Edge AI Systems:

Developing with Jetson Orin Nano/NX/AGX for real-time object detection, voice/face biometrics, and autonomous robotics.
‚úÖ 40‚Äì275 AI TOPS edge computing with YOLO, OpenCV, DeepStream.
Medical RAG Agents + MCP Pipelines:

Prototyping agentic retrieval systems for smart hospitals, integrating WBAN (Wireless Body Area Network) sensor streams and digital twin contexts via Module Context Protocol.
Cloud + Simulation:

Training & testing on H100/B100/B200 GPUs, with Isaac Sim for synthetic data, Omniverse for robotics digital twins, and Isaac ROS 2 on embedded platforms.
AI Automation + Security:

Smart meters + AOI (Automated Optical Inspection), blockchain-integrated payment flows, SQL fuzz testing, and factory-level TCP/IP control dashboards.
